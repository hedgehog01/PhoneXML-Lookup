PhoneXML Lookup - Version 0.0.4

What's new:
1. Image should load when phone selected (Let me know if doesn't work).
2. Clicking on the image with the mouse will open the image.
3. Added App log output to help debug issues.

Future items:
1. Get vendor result for searches (i.e. what are the vendors that contain Android devices etc.)

For any issues or ideas send email to Nathan R.

Enjoy!
